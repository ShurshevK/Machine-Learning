# MASTER THESIS
Sales forecasting is one of the most important analysis for retailers, based on which the strategic decisions are made. Therefore, it is necessary to understand how such sales data is shaped and how to forecast it. Like many other economic time series, aggregate retail sales have strong trend and seasonal variations. How best to model and forecast these patterns has long been a topic of time series analysis.
The goal of the research of this paper is to answer which traditional and complex forecasting techniques such as neural networks are used for sales forecasting and which of them have good accuracy. For this purpose, the following established null hypotheses are stated: 1) methods with higher complexity are not more accurate than simple methods; 2) different error measures lead to different rankings of the methods; 3) the performance of a method depends on the extension of the forecast horizon. To answer the null hypotheses, a quantitative comparative study was conducted. The results show that NNs and traditional statistical methods followed by the Box-Jenkins model perform almost equally on average. However, the individual statistical error measures do not always give a clear indication of the prediction performance. Therefore, different error measures were considered to address this issue.
